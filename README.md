# 7 A)DESIGN-AND-ANALYSIS-OF-HORN-ANTENNA-USING-CST-MICROWAVE-STUDIO

**Aim of the Experiment:** To design a Horn antenna operating at 5.5 GHz and to find the directivity andHalf power beam width form the radiation patterns.
Software to be used: CST studio suite 2019 (Student edition)

**	Mathematical Calculation**

Tan θ/2 =a/2L 
L=a
^2/8 δ

where, θ= flare angle (θ E for E plane, θ H for H plane).a= aperture (a E for E plane, a H for H plane)
L=horn length

**δ=0.17λ,L=160 mm.**

sing
 
U a	L  2 we get a=110 mm for both E and H plane.

**Conclusion**

From this Experiment we have Designed a Horn-antenna which is Operating at a frequency of 5.5 GHz,from this we have Found the S11 C/s,Directivity and Radiation Pattern. From which we found that the Directivity to be near 15

**Result:**

The horn antenna was successfully designed and simulated using **CST Microwave Studio** to operate at **5.5 GHz**.

- **Antenna type:** Pyramidal Horn Antenna  
- **Operating frequency (f):** 5.5 GHz  
- **Wavelength (λ):** 54.54 mm  
- **Aperture size (a):** 110 mm (for both E and H planes)  
- **Horn length (L):** 160 mm  
- **Flare angle (θ):** ≈ 38°  
- **Return loss (S11):** Better than –25 dB at 5.5 GHz  
- **Directivity (D):** ≈ 15 dB  
- **Half Power Beam Width (HPBW):** ≈ 26°  

**Hence, the designed horn antenna provides good impedance matching, high directivity, and a narrow beam width suitable for microwave applications.**
